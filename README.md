## Description

This program is designed to efficiently create a website that

shows the members of a team, including the manager, engineers, 

and interns. You can add any number of employees that you'd like.


## Usage

If the program were to run correctly, it would be pretty useful 

in making a chart that allows you to quickly see all team members

in a group, organization, etc.

## Status

The status of this program is not a good one. I'm not sure how

the project managed to become so difficult. I had a good portion

of it done around friday-saturday, and I was going to finish it

today since I believed I didn't have much left to do. In the video,

I will demonstrate what happens in my program, and then what the

actual outcome was supposed to be. I created a html file "expected.html"

that shows what it was supposed to generate
